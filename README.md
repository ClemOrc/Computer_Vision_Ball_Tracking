**Volleyball Ball Tracking and Trajectory Prediction**
This project focuses on detecting, tracking, and predicting the movement of a volleyball in video footage using YOLOv8 for object detection and LSTM for trajectory prediction. The system ensures smooth tracking by filtering out false detections and estimating the ball’s future position based on its past trajectory.
